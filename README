A template/tutorial for how to get (and refresh) a cookie with selenium in python, so a script can make calls to a public API through requests. Prints out the first 10 billionaire's place of employment.

Why? - It's ideal to not scrape a front end due to the fact any changes in the DOM could break your scraper, and instead we should intercept API requests. For this, you usually need cookies to trick the server into thinking you've actually been on the site.

I use Poetry for env and package management - it's great.
